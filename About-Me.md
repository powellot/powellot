## About-Me

I’m Owen Powell, **[@powellot](https://github.com/powellot)** here on GitHub. I'm an enthusiastic learner trying to further my professional skills and am using GitHub to host and display my projects to potential employers.

Below you can see the languages I currently work in, and my proficiency in each of them. In addition, my GitHub will have several repositories showcasing my favorite projects from each stage of my learning. Many of these will present a problem and give several
solutions based on a user's goals and the time complexities of each in Big θ runtimes. For any questions or comments regarding my projects, kindly email 
powellot.dev@gmail.com.
