## Basic About-Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Owen Powell, **[@powellot](https://github.com/powellot)** here on GitHub. I'm a student at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and am using github to host 
and display my projects to potential employers as well as other students.

Below you can see the languages I currently work in, my proficiency in each of them, along with any relevant courses I've taken during my time at university. In addition 
to this, my GitHub will have several repositories showcasing my favorite projects from each stage of my learning. Many of these will present a problem and give several
solutions based on a users goals and the time complexities of each in Big Î¸ runtimes. For any questions or comments regarding my projects, kindly email 
powellot.dev@gmail.com.
